# Willus.com's K2pdfopt

K2pdfopt optimizes PDF/DJVU files for mobile e-readers (e.g. the Kindle) and smartphones.

## Description

K2pdfopt works well on multi-column PDF/DJVU files and can re-flow text even on scanned PDF files. It can also be used as a general PDF copying/cropping/re-sizing/OCR-ing manipulation tool. It can generate native or bitmapped PDF output, with an optional OCR layer. There are downloads for MS Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux. The MS Windows version has an integrated GUI. K2pdfopt is open source.

Note to MS Office 365 users: The latest version of MS Word in Office 365 very intelligently and faithfully converts PDFs to MS Word format, which then gives you a lot of capability to re-format your document. So you may want to try opening your PDF in MS Word before using k2pdfopt on it.
